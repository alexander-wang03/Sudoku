# Sudoku
This C program encompasses both a Sudoku Solver and a Sudoku Generator. It allows users to either input and solve a Sudoku puzzle or generate a new one. 

Sudoku Solver:
The Sudoku Solver part uses backtracking to find solutions to user-provided puzzles, ensuring each row, column, and 3x3 subgrid follows Sudoku rules. 

Sudoku Generator:
The Generator creates a valid Sudoku grid by randomly filling the diagonal 3x3 boxes, completing the remaining cells, and then removing a certain number of cells to form a puzzle. 

The program starts with a menu for users to select either solving or generating a Sudoku puzzle.
